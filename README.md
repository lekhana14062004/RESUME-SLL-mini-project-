the topic of my survey is resume validating softwaares
therefore i have created a mini project rearding the implementaion of the same using linkedlist in the above code
In the above program we have used linked list to represent the fields of the job applicants like name,qualification,work experience,phone number and age.Each applicant's data is stored in one node using structures
In this program we have used functions like insert front,insert rear,display,count,search
the insert front function is used to add the job applicant details to the front of the linked list
the insert rear function is used to add the job appplicant details to the rear of the linked list
the display function is used to display the details of all the job applicants
the count function is used to display how many applicants have applied for the job
the search function is sued if we want to get the entire details of the applicant by using the name of the applicant
